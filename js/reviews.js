Still, everything main quest related (demigods, npc quests) is so masterfully crafted that alone places the game high in my fromsoft top, but reused ideas can ruin the overall enjoyment.<br/>GOTY no doubt, waiting for the DLC.",

I remember not being able to deal with the spiral staircase in Latria 3-2 in the OG Demon's Souls leading to the maneaters because of those damn mindflayers and reaching a level of rage past yelling or breaking controllers (those cost money, don't waste money) and just calmly, quietly taking the disc out and putting it on eBay with the same kind of emotionless automation of a sim and never touching it again. Fast forward to every person on Earth playing this thing and the hype is too much, man, it's gorgeous, the reviews are through the roof, streams look dope, I gotta play this. But on easy mode, of course. Heard that magic was easy mode so I did the whole use the rune boosting chicken foot and taking out the giant dragon's tail with that bleedy morning star and then skipping a boss and horse it past some secret areas to get an overpowered sword that I was in NO way prepared to get normally and now I'm one-shotting hard enemies (when not getting surprised by a dragonfly or crab because oh my god this game is so punishing) and loving it! The game tells you NOTHING and I should hate that but it brought me back to MS-DOS games that were made with the expectation of you fumbling around for at least tens of hours before realizing that you could've done twice as much in just 4 minutes if you knew where you were supposed to go. A few headaches later and the exhilarating feeling of getting gud washed over me. First two attempts were rough. I didn't know where the Church of Elleh was, how to get the horse, level up, whatever, you name it, I just got out of the first area and then ended up stuck in some cave with a golem boss I couldn't hurt. Started over and ended up stuck in that Caelid crystal mine dealing with the centipede dudes because I had no idea the exit was so close. Random dogs are killing me and I'm level 42 and I'm pissed about that and it's all kind of terrific for some reason, you know?",

Little Nightmares 2 feels more like some leftover ideas from the first one, which are stitched together in some weird ways. The enemy design and overall graphics are totally lovely and some gameplay mechanics are pretty neat, but I think it would be a much better game if it would be as short and dense as part 1. Especially the \"combat\" and the last level are just super tedious and it's sometimes a little bit too much trial and error for my taste. Besides some terrible game breaking bugs, there has been a few moments where I just didn't know what to do. This rarely happens to me. Little Nightmares 2 is still a good game, but throwing in some cool new mechanics and that ending doesn't automatically make it better. Imo, the first one has a much better world design, story telling and atmosphere. Nightmares 2 has some really brilliant moments, but fails as an overall idea and concept when compared to it's precursor!",

Sometimes using the flashlight or weapons can be a little tedious (weapons are very heavy and take a longer windup time, and there are sections where you'll need to constantly wave the flashlight around), but overall? Way more fun to play, and offers enough of a challenge without making me want to rage quit.<br/><br/>The game is delightfully sinister and creepy, with genuinely scary villains and a truly shocking twist ending.

        "body": "After the too close for comfort clash with the Baker family in Louisana, Resident Evil Village attempts to match that creepy tone and do more. Much more. As a result, this tale has facets of methodical horror combined with the ridiculous action of Resident Evil 5 or 6. While some players may not enjoy one or the other, undeniably Capcom does both very well. A better mix of the survival horror and extreme action could have made this stronger overall, as the messy pacing, lacking antagonist development, and easing difficulty hurt the overall adventure. The final package is still a wonderful spectacle of a video game. It’s entertaining, it’s engrossing, and it’s Resident Evil in every aspect. With the best visual/audio design in the series’ and a satisfying Metroidvania world design, Resident Evil Village is unmissable.<br/><br/>Full review at <a href=\"https: //checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2021/05/resident-evil-village-review-you-about-to-see-something-wonderful/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2021/05/resident-evil-village-review-you-about-to-see-something-wonderful/</a>",

        "body": "This is a fantastic entry in the franchise, I've really enjoyed the shift towards the first-person perspective and how the series has used it to bring back some scares. The flow of the world at times felt clunky, I enjoyed the amount of missable areas, but the exploration felt too easy compared to the earlier games (that this seemingly takes more influence from), while also being a little bit too open and indirect compared to RE7 (which is a very effective linear experience). <br/>But most importantly, this game strikes a perfect balance between some legitimately fucked up and interesting horror with the larger action set pieces of the 4-6 entries. House Beneviento stands out as one of the highlights for me, not just in this game, but in the franchise as a whole. This game, even more than RE7, returns to one of the prime factors that stood out as the main source of horror in the original trilogy, which is grotesque body horror, and RE8 has plenty of that.",

        "body": "Concise Review:<br/>Amazing graphics (excellent lighting when played in a dark room) and a very cool setting/environment. Entertaining story and characters. The atmosphere and sound design is very effective at building tension. Not as scary or disturbing as biohazard but still plenty of effective spooky elements. I jumped and yelled on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Movement feels slow and gunplay feels loose but for the survival horror genre it’s alright as it forces you to make shots count. Still I wish the gunplay felt a bit tighter.<br/><br/>Journal Style Review:<br/><br/>First impressions. Graphics look really good. The sound design is adding to the intensity. I loved Mia getting shot out of nowhere. The opening didn’t mess around which I appreciated. I’m liking the new setting. The initial werewolves and werewolf chief attack was great and the spooky witch cackling afterwards was great.  This game isn’t as scary or spooky as the last but the jump scares have still got me early on. It is intense.<br/><br/>Just got into the castle. I’m really liking this game. It’s a great horror action adventure set in this awesome setting. I turned on ray tracing and it looks very nice. Great start.<br/><br/>The cutscenes have pretty much all been great. I loved when Ethan got his hand cut off and then he just sticks it back on. The big fat merchant is also great. Solid characters.<br/><br/>I loved escaping the Nic cage sounding guy’s trap sequence. Very fun. And the graphics just look soo good.<br/><br/>I loved the castle section. Not sure how I feel about the big lady turning into that weird tentacle monster after that knife stab. I was liking the other style more but we will see where this goes. I’ve really enjoyed the first 3.5ish hours of this game.<br/><br/>I loved the hag again. She’s great. I’m happy the game went back to the “village” vibe, for the time being. It got me really good on the look out the window jump scare. There have been good creepy jump scares throughout.<br/><br/>The graphics look amazing, specifically the environment with ray tracing on. Really enjoying this game. It’s fun. It’s tense. I’m digging the story. I like it a lot.<br/><br/>Dollhouse and goo baby section was very creepy. I yelled a lot. I loved it. The atmosphere and change of pace was great.<br/><br/>The fish guy wasn’t bad either. Not as good as the previous boss sections but still decent.<br/><br/>I love Heisenberg. He is a great character. Big fan of the voice actor channeling Nic Cage. His level was cool too. I like the robot corpses. Not quite as scary as the some of the other sections, although, this is probably also due to it being later in the game and me being less scared of death.<br/><br/>Final Heisenberg section and then the Chris redfield section was great.  Nice change up. Wish the combat felt smoother during that section though. I don’t know how to change the sensitivity to feel better. Loved the section though.<br/><br/>Conclusion to the story wasn’t anything special, but I expected a really dumb ending so it was actually better than I had hoped for. Great game. I’ll be playing the next resident evil game. Sign me up for one more and make it something entirely new once again.<br/><br/>Final Score: A-",

One of the most beautiful games ever made with each area being a treat to the eyes, whether it's the swamps of Velen, the city of Novigrad, the islands of Skellige or the lush countryside of Toussaint. World building is top notch - I always enjoy reading the bestiary and journal entries of various characters you meet. The characters are all fantastic, Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer, Trish, etc. are instantly likable and interesting, and while Eredin might not be the best villain ever made, it is more than made up for with Gaunter o'Dimm and Detlaff van der Eretain in the two DLCs. The story is gripping from beginning to end and the side quests are equally fantastic as well. Music is also great, especially in the Skellige region. Role play aspect is also done very well, I rarely if ever felt like my dialogue options were meaningless. Gwent is also quite addicting. <br/><br/>Again, combat could be better and there are quite a lot of bugs but otherwise it's an absolute must-buy and is a game that sets the standards for RPGs everywhere.",

The main story was great, but I have to agree with what a lot of people thought, which was that the Blood and Wine expansion was just as good if not better than the main story. Toussaint and the many additions (grandmaster armor, mutagens, Corvo Bianco, etc.) all played into a fantastic ending to the Witcher 3. On my playthrough, I think I got the best ending: saving Syanna, killing Dettlaff, and despite Regis being exiled, Geralt and him part amicably which I liked. The ending was a nice cap to the main story. Hearts of Stone was good as well - Ogeird was a character, and Gaunter O’Grimm certainly made things interesting. Enjoyed all the different areas, Skellige and Toussaint being my favorite (except for the fact that so many points of interest in Skellige were in the water and required a boat). There were certainly parts towards the end where I was tired of continuing to play...but I’m glad I finished it.

        "body": "The Witcher 3 is by far my favorite game I've ever played.  There are no words that accurately describe the feeling this game gives you when you play it for the first time.  The multiple astounding themes this game presents from politics to family, from war to love, and from loyalty to differing beliefs, they all make The Witcher 3 feel grounded in reality while still being a fantasy game.  What makes this game so great is its astounding writing.  Every quest you do, every character you encounter, every monster you fight, feels real in the sense that the characters and stories are never two dimensional.  Every character has a story to tell, and the characters will present you with tough decisions that will make you question your morals.  Another thing that makes this game so exceptional is its characters, specifically the main cast.  Every character in this game is fleshed out with hours of content that make you care about them.  Every character has their own identity and personality that makes for some of the best chemistry between characters a game has ever seen.  From Geralt's charisma to Yennefer's sarcasm from Zoltan's wit to Vezemir's wisdom, all make for a memorable cast that people can invest and sympathize with on a deeper level.  Now it might sound like I am praising this game to no end, but I would like to state that before going into the game, I had a very closed mind.  From what I saw through videos and from what I heard from friends, I thought the game was going to be too hardcore and another generic unrealistic fantasy game with no relatability to the player.  So this game had to fight against an (unfair) negative bias I had and still managed to not only surpass my low expectations but it managed to climb the ranks of my favorite games.  Genuinely, the only thing I didn't like about the game was after I beat all the main content and DLC, I felt a void because the story and characters I got invested in had to come to an end. All in all, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a really good singleplayer story game.",

Halo Infinite introduces open-world elements that don’t distract from the main story and add value to its replayability and memorable action. Even with the inclusion of the thrilling Grappleshot, the gameplay still maintains its signature feel. Multiplayer may need a lot of finetuning, but it costs nothing to play and provides plenty of frantic fun for a group of friends and solo players. With more features and additions to come, Halo Infinite isn’t slowing down… No. I think we’re just getting started.<br/><br/>Full review at <a href=\"https: //checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2021/12/halo-infinite-review-king-of-the-hill/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2021/12/halo-infinite-review-king-of-the-hill/</a>",

        "body": "Journal Style Review:<br/><br/>Love the power move of the unannounced multiplayer release. The performance was pretty solid on day one. A few glitchy moments but overall good and I found games in like 5 seconds every time. Halo is back and I fucking love it. Early impressions of this halo are fucking good. They just need enough content and reason to keep playing. The foundation is there.<br/><br/>I bought the season pass which is the first I’ve ever bought. The multiplayer is free which they didn’t have to do so I like the idea of supporting the game. Opening night impressions is I’m not going to love the challenges system. It makes me feel like some games are pointless because I couldn’t possibly progress any of the weekly challenges. I’d rather there be a traditional leveling system for playlists. Even if they only had a rank, no unlocks. I’d like that added.<br/><br/>I hope we get a good statistics page. Previous halos had good stats and I’ll be bummed if this one doesn’t add it in later.<br/><br/>Challenges already slightly modified to make it so every daily is just 50xp for a match. That’s a bit better but I think there should be a bonus 50xp for winning the match. There needs to be motivation to win. Some games I don’t give a shit about winning because I’m desperately trying to splatter somebody.<br/><br/>I think the shock rifle feels better. I love the new sniper/carbine gun. This halo feels good. I just hope they continue to improve the progression system , add a stats page, and continue to add many more playlists and maps etc. Strong start though. I’m not in a rush with this halo. I think it sticks around for awhile and just gets better and better. I can see this being a game I keep coming back to. <br/><br/>So far I’m not liking the challenge system. It’s not the worst. But it is definitely causing more frustration than joy and satisfaction. It isn’t encouraging me to play the game in different ways. It’s forcing me to do things that are not practical or beneficial and most importantly, not fun. It feels like a chore to do the challenges, and to not do the challenges feels like a waste. So it’s lose lose. I hope it gets changed.<br/><br/>Damn this game feels good. I love that they added fiesta. I hope they continue to add new playlists regularly. Keep it fresh. I also had a good streak of challenges that weren’t too difficult. It’s a lot more fun when I’m just trying to win games rather than complete weird specific tasks. <br/><br/>First two weeks impressions is the challenge system ultimately needs to be changed. It needs to be improved upon for this halo to reach its potential. I had a challenge to win 1 stockpile game. I had played 9 big teams in a row before getting stockpile and then my team got crushed even though I had a heroic game. Took another 6 games to get another stockpile where we crushed. I was having fun still but not nearly as much much as when I was actually progressing the challenges. This is always going to be the case to some degree. There will be easy weeks and lucky weeks where the game modes and maps line up well for the challenges but there will be streaks like this where the challenges just suck the fun out of the game. Still really like the feel of the game though. Best halo feel ever.<br/><br/>My biggest needs:<br/>- Triple the amount of playlists<br/>- The ability to filter what game modes you play<br/>- Xp for winning games, and ideally also based on individual performance.<br/>- I still need my stats page. <br/>I feel some fatigue with playing the same modes over and over when I’m trying to get a specific game type for a challenge. I still love the look and feel of this halo but as it currently stands it’s a high A-. I see potential for an A or even A+ once they get more content and make the necessary QOL changes. I hope it makes it there before too long.<br/><br/>Started the campaign! Opening couple of missions are decent. Pretty solid start.<br/><br/>I’m going to love this campaign. lm really liking the open world aspect to it. The voice acting and sound design in general is fucking unreal. <br/><br/>I’ve played enough to already safely say this is my favourite halo campaign. It’s so good. At this point I like the campaign more than the multiplayer and that is very unexpected.<br/><br/>It’s hard to guess how many hours I’ve logged but I’d guess I’m like 14 hours in? I love the campaign. Best halo campaign to date. The progression is well done. The map exploration is amazing because of the grapple and the nice looking environment. The unique upgraded weapons are very fun. Even the story is great. I’m very pleased with how fun it is. It was likely that Infinite was eventually going to end up an A or higher, but I didn’t expect the campaign to be the reason it gets bumped up to an A, but here we are. Campaign is currently an A.<br/><br/>Finished the campaign. It ended a bit quicker than I expected but still overall I loved it.<br/><br/>I hate tactical slayer. It’s the only game mode I really don’t like.<br/><br/>Almost done the season 1 BP. The BP was disappointing and the amount/quality of the cosmetics is weak. But even if the gear was super cool I still don’t like how the challenge system encourages people to play. It doesn’t encourage competing and fun gameplay, it encourages random and forced encounters. As it stands it’s a low A. With the addition of more maps, game modes, guns, forge, a non BP ranking or progression system, and/or a BR mode this game could potentially jump to an A+, but if they wait too long to get it right the effect may not be the same.<br/><br/>Current Score: A",

        "body": "Journal Style Review:<br/><br/>Opening impressions from the first couple hours are I don’t get the praise. On the positive side, I’ve already chuckled a few times, and it has shown solid real life advice in clever ways. I can see why critics like the positive message for the kids. Now the negatives. I don’t like the movement or jumping which is a huge part of this game. It feels too slow? Or maybe it’s that it feels loose? The combat and gameplay in general is pretty boring. I get it’s a kids game but lots of games are kids games and they are fun to play. Next big complaint which I’m shocked about because I thought it was going to be good is the art style and graphics are pretty underwhelming. I guess it’s not a big AAA game which I thought it was going to be but the graphic fidelity is weak. The art side of it has been okay with the brain levels but I’m still very much underwhelmed. It must get better because I can’t believe this game got like 89 or whatever on opencritic. <br/><br/>I don’t mind the story but I’m still not high on the gameplay.<br/><br/>Jack Blacks Brain level has been the best so far. That one actually looks pretty nice. The different style to it worked. The gameplay is still mostly boring.<br/><br/>I wish there was more combat sections and it was a bit more action and a bit less platforming. That being said I like the story and the world. They did a good job on that. I still don’t think it deserves the 9/10s it got but the story and world have been fun. They have done a good job with making unique creative levels.<br/><br/>By the last act I was bored and just wanted to see how it would end. The art style isn’t good enough to carry the boring gameplay. This game is over rated because it touches on a lot of good topics in regards to mental health and life in general. It delivers a positive message in an effective manner… but it’s boring.<br/><br/>Finished it. Happy to be done. By the end I was over it. Final review thoughts… this games over rated.<br/><br/>Final Score: B",

        "body": "This is a tough one to talk about. I seem to be in the minority that thought LiS2 was fantastic and I was looking forward to this franchise continuing to grow in that direction. Compared to LiS2 this feels a little safe, but overall I enjoyed myself. <br/><br/>I think the characters are charming and the drama hard hitting enough to pull you into the story. I was honor-bound to make sure Alex Chen made it out of this story safe and sound and happy. The choice for superpower and the mechanic was cool enough.  <br/><br/>Mystery returns as an important element of this game, much as it was in the first LiS and in Deck Nines other title BtS. I think this is something fans were missing — and I get it, I love a good mystery — but I don’t think this is a particular strong point of this game. The answers were pretty obvious, the threat ill-defined, and it felt almost disconnected from everything that’s happening until the end. <br/><br/>I think the bigger picture problem is that this game screams that it’s a practice in frugality. This new engine looks great! Art design is fabulous. But there are very few characters and locations and even fewer that are actually important. The power is a good match for a choice based adventure, but you are given few characters with which to interact and few opportunities to use your power. And when you do use your power, most of the time you are told directly what your objective is and how to best get what you need to push the story forward. If you were hoping the empathy power would lead to a deep dialogue tree and player choice, it doesn’t really come close. All in all it translated to less game and less agency over the direction the story is headed, which is unfortunate. I feel like a few tweaks and this could’ve been great as I was really invested in the characters. For now it’s a cool little game that came out. <br/><br/>Also, I apologize to all my fellow gays but I’m Team Ryan. Literally fight me.",

The atmosphere and the spooky style to the game is great and the card game mechanics were fun as well. <br/><br/>The first change up where we see a guys videos is interesting. I’m definitely intrigued.<br/><br/>I’ve escaped 4 or 5 times. The card game is losing steam but I had a few runs where I didn’t really progress as much as I could because of the escape room stuff. I’m now focused on that escape.  I’m looking forward to the next acts. I’m close.<br/><br/>Beat the game. Very much enjoyed it. The leshy act was my favourite. I still liked the next two and the change up was good, and needed, but they didn’t top the opening, and they were kind of easy by that point. The story was a lot of fun but I am a bit let down with the ending. I thought Luke’s ending was anticlimactic. I really enjoyed his videos and I thought there would be more. I didn’t find all the story Easter eggs and tid bits, but it felt like there was going to be more too it. Still a fun weird game.<br/><br/>Final Score B+",

        "body": "Extremely remarkable art, narration, story, music and gameplay. The battle system with the dice and the cards is VERY well done, engaging and super fun!<br/><br/>Still some issues with the game:<br/>- it needs some balancing with the coins and the rewards. By the middle of the story I had already unlocked all the cards from the shop. And had no real incentive to even go to the store anymore. There are SO MANY coins around that by the end of the game I had 3000 spare coins, and nothing to spend them on.<br/>- SPOILER: The final battle with the queen is just underwhelming. The fight is hyped up during the whole game, and when you finally get there, is essentially a disappointment. The fight with the mayor of Two town is FAR more difficult than the queen. How is it possible that she doesn’t even have different phases or forms? This suffers from the same issue that Breath of the Wild has: Amazing game, with underwhelming final boss.<br/><br/>Still, highly recommended, specially if you like games like American McGee’s Alice and Little Nightmares. I would just tell you to adjust your expectations with the final boss.",
